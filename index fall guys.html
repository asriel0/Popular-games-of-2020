    <p>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a platformer battle royale game developed by Mediatonic and published by Devolver Digital. It released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 on 4 August 2020. The game draws inspiration from game shows like Takeshi's Castle, It's a Knockout and Wipeout, and children's playground games like tag and British bulldog.Fall Guys received positive reviews from critics, who praised its chaotic gameplay and visual appearance.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Up to 60 players compete in matches with battle royale-style gameplay.Players, represented as jellybean-like figures,move around a three-dimensional playing field, with additional moves such as jumping, grabbing/climbing, or diving to assist gameplay.The aim is to qualify for subsequent rounds by successfully completing each of the randomly selected mini-games.Certain mini-games involve running towards a finish line at the end of the map, while others add elements of teamwork.On every mini-game, obstacles appear around the map for added complexity.Players who are too slow or who fail certain requirements for a mini-game are eliminated. On the final round, the remaining few players compete in a final match with a randomised mini-game designed for a smaller player size.The winner of the match is the last player standing.

    <p>Tom Wiggins of Stuff magazine praised the game, calling it "Super Monkey Ball for the Fortnite generation".Mercury News praised the "controlled chaos" gameplay of Fall Guys, stating it to be utilizing a combination of the elements from the battle royale game Fortnite and the party game Mario Party in such a way that made it "tailored to the coronavirus age".</p>
    <br>
    <p>The weekend before release during a closed beta, Fall Guys briefly became the most watched game on Twitch as well as the sixth-best-selling Steam game where it was available for pre-order.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While the two games are not functionally similar, Fall Guys has been frequently compared to Among Us, in that both are online games which grew in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
